# Processing scripts for LPJ-GUESS spruce bark beetle model simulations

Matlab scripts for processing the data underlaying a submitted manuscript “Combining empirical and mechanistic understanding of spruce bark beetle outbreak dynamics in the LPJ-GUESS (v4.1, r13130) vegetation model” (Lagergren F., Jönsson A. M., Lindeskog M., and Pugh T. A. M.). The simulation results used as input to these scripts can be found at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14415079), and the LPJ-GUESS code and simulation settings for producing those results are also stored at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14411974).
